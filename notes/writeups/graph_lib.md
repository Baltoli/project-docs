# Event Graph Library

The code in this library is absolutely horrendous - one of my first tasks in the
summer will be to completely rationalise it (probably needs a full rewrite given
everything that I now know about the model checking algorithm!).

Extending the code that I've already written to go into the event graph library
has been absolutely horrendous - I designed it to be flexible but that's been an
abject failure so far. Needs some serious software engineering / C++ work to be
usable in the future. Will definitely benefit from knowing in advance what it's
going to be used for.
