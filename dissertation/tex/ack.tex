\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express sincere thanks to Dr.\ Robert Watson for his patient and
insightful supervision of this project throughout the year, without which none
of my work would have been possible. Additional thanks go to Professor Alan
Mycroft for graciously providing feedback on an early draft of the dissertation.
The original authors of TESLA and the CADETS team have been a great help to me,
for which they have my thanks (not least for providing an interesting starting
point for this project!). Particular thanks go to Dr.\ Jonathan Anderson for
discussing early ideas with me, and providing technical assistance with TESLA.
Finally, I would like to thank Professor Simon Moore, Professor Jane Clarke, my
family and friends for the support and guidance they have given me this year and
throughout my degree.
