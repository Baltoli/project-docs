In this chapter I discuss potential applications of statically checked TESLA to
practical software engineering scenarios. I provide an analysis of how coding
style can make writing TESLA assertions for a system more difficult, with
reference to a large open-source library. Then, motivated by this difficulty, I
describe a general method for applying TESLA to library interfaces with minimal
modification to client code. Finally, I demonstrate a practical application of
this technique by adding TESLA instrumentation to the interface of a \lwip{}, a
widely-used network protocol library.

\section{\lwip{}} \label{sec:lwip}

An initial goal of the project was to investigate how TESLA might be
applied to verify the behaviour of a larger state machine such as that
of TCP. However, this verification proved to be more difficult than
anticipated due to a number of C programming idioms and design choices present
in \lwip{}.

In this section I investigate the application of TESLA to \lwip{}
\cite{dunkels_design_2001}, a widely used, portable implementation of
the IP protocol stack. I describe difficulties encountered in this
process with reference to the \lwip{} source, as well as an analysis of how
code written from scratch with TESLA instrumentation in mind could
mitigate these issues.

\subsection{Structure}

\lwip{} is distributed as a configurable library so that it can be built on
virtually any platform with a C compiler---interfaces to network
buffers, timers and other platform-specific code are abstracted so that
their implementation can be supplied by users. Configurations for
widely used operating systems (generic Unix, Windows etc.) are
distributed as a secondary library together with example applications.

The core networking code of \lwip{} is around 57K lines of C.\footnote{Not
including header files or tests.} This code includes implementations of IPV4,
IPV6, TCP, UDP and several application-layer protocols. The secondary library
has around 13K lines of C, mostly contained in implementations of executable
server applications (HTTP, Telnet, SMTP etc.).

\subsection{Investigation}

The goal of my investigation into \lwip{} was to instrument the core TCP
implementation with useful TESLA assertions, then to demonstrate that
performance improvements were attainable by applying static analysis to
this instrumentation.

Before any investigation could be performed, a version of \lwip{} built using TESLA
was required. Each of the \lwip{}-based server applications is built using a
Makefile that compiles the core library separately, then links the
application-specific code with the core library. Modifying this build system to
use the TESLA infrastructure was not difficult, as much of the setup (flags,
includes, linking etc.) was in place already---the only changes needed were to
add the extra TESLA-specific rules and to compile to bitcode instead of object
files. The changes made totalled 49 lines of Makefile code.

The end result of this modification was that any of the example applications
distributed with \lwip{} could be instrumented and built using TESLA. Based on
this modified build of \lwip{}, I investigated how TESLA could be applied to
internal library code. The remainder of this section describes the features
found in the source code that made applying TESLA (statically analysed or
otherwise) more difficult.

\subsubsection{TCP State Implementation}

At the core of the TCP protocol implementation is a structure
representing a single TCP connection (\mintinline{c}{struct tcp_pcb}).
Almost all of the TCP protocol implementation is expressed in terms of
these structures---\autoref{lst:tcp-decls} contains some function
declarations taken from the source code that use the structure.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{minted}{c}
err_t tcp_bind(struct tcp_pcb *pcb, const ip_addr_t *ipaddr, u16_t port);

err_t tcp_close(struct tcp_pcb *pcb);

struct tcp_pcb * tcp_listen_with_backlog(struct tcp_pcb *pcb, u8_t backlog)
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Function declarations from the \lwip{} TCP implementation.}
  \label{lst:tcp-decls}
\end{figure}

Such heavy reliance on structure fields is less than ideal because TMC cannot
check assertions that reference structure field assignments, though checking
assignments to structure fields is within the capabilities of TESLA at runtime.
A further complication is that the implementation is not consistent in its use
of PCB structures---some functions modify a structure instance passed to them
(\mintinline{c}{tc_pbind}, \mintinline{c}{tcp_close}), while others return an
entirely new instance (\mintinline{c}{tcp_listen_with_backlog}). The latter
style of function is more difficult to instrument effectively in TESLA because
the object being asserted about may change midway through an assertion, which is
difficult to express using the TESLA assertion language.

\subsubsection{Macro Usage}

In order for \lwip{} to be universally portable, it makes heavy use of the
C preprocessor for a number of reasons. For example:
\begin{description}
  \item[Platform-specific implementations] The implementation of some
  functions can vary from system to system (e.g.\ endianness conversion
  functions). Macros are used to select the correct implementation of
  these functions without the overhead of a function call. This means
  that any TESLA assertions added to these functions would become
  platform-specific, and duplicated between implementations.

  \item[Conditional Compilation] Almost every feature of \lwip{} can be
  enabled, disabled or modified at compile-time by setting the correct
  preprocessor definitions (this is what allows \lwip{} to be used so
  effectively on systems with limited resources). This feature
  is used in places to conditionally change the fields contained in a
  structure---any assertions written about that field must then be aware
  of the required \mintinline{c}{#ifdef} context.

  \item[Inlined Functions] Some simple ``functions'' in \lwip{} are expressed using
    macros to guarantee that there is no function call overhead, rather than
    relying on the compiler to inline them. These function-like macros cannot be
    asserted about by TESLA\footnote{Because TESLA runs after preprocessing has
    been applied to the source code.}, and are difficult to distinguish in source code.
\end{description}

Together, these uses of the macro system make TESLA instrumentation more difficult to add
to the \lwip{} source.

\subsubsection{Control Flow}

TESLA assertions are most useful (especially when using static analysis)
for asserting properties related to control flow events. However, the
style in which \lwip{} code is written means that there is little explicit
control flow within the protocol implementation itself---many functions
perform complicated work on a PCB structure, then call only a single
other function to send a packet.

In addition to the long functions and shallow call graph in the TCP
implementation, applying TESLA becomes even more difficult because of the way
users of the TCP implementation call into it---code that uses the TCP
implementation must register a set of callback functions that are called at
certain points in the protocol's execution. This means that control flow moves
between user and library code through a \emph{dynamic} interface that cannot be
reasoned about easily with TESLA. \autoref{lst:callbacks} shows an extract from the TCP
echo server in which these callbacks are registered.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{minted}{c}
tcp_recv(newpcb, tcpecho_raw_recv);
tcp_err(newpcb, tcpecho_raw_error);
tcp_poll(newpcb, tcpecho_raw_poll, 0);
tcp_sent(newpcb, tcpecho_raw_sent);
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Callback registration for a user of the \lwip{} TCP implementation}
  \label{lst:callbacks}
\end{figure}

Registered callbacks are stored as members of a PCB structure. This
behaviour defeats TESLA instrumentation (both static and
dynamic)---there is currently no way to express \textquote{the function
\texttt{pcb.member} is eventually called} in the assertion language.
Unfortunately, these callback functions contain much of the behaviour
that would be well-served by TESLA instrumentation. For example, the
\lwip{}
documentation\footnote{\url{http://lwip.wikia.com/wiki/Raw/TCP\#Receiving_TCP_data}}
describes the mandated behaviour of a particular callback function:

\begin{displayquote}[\lwip{} Wiki]
When the application has processed the incoming data, it must call the
\mintinline{c}{tcp_recved()} function to indicate that TCP can increase
the receive window.
\end{displayquote}

Because of the callback interface, instrumenting the invariants of this
function could only be done by the consumer of the library (rather than
the author of the library). This means that the author of the library
can do little beyond documentation to ensure correct usage of the API
functions. In \autoref{sec:safer-libs} I show how this problem can be partially
solved using TESLA.

\textcite{anderson_tesla:_2014} did not encounter the problems related to
callbacks that I describe here---the assertions they wrote are targeted at a
complete system implementation where every function of interest is known ahead
of time. This means that even if a function is called through a structure
interface, it can still be instrumented. This is not the case when unknown user
code is responsible for registering the callback functions, as is the case with
\lwip{}.

\subsection{Summary}

The \lwip{} TCP library presents an interesting target for verification with TESLA.
However, the style in which the library is written means that applying TESLA
assertions to the internal code is both difficult and unlikely to yield any
useful insight into the behaviour of the library. Further informal investigation
into the FreeBSD TCP implementation yielded much the same conclusions, and it is
likely that other similar libraries would suffer the same problems.
Additionally, the use of a callback-based API for users of the library means
that TESLA cannot be directly applied in the situation where it would be most
useful (enforcing temporal assertions on consumer code). An interesting
direction for future work would be to quantify the degree of modification
required for library code to be usefully instrumented with TESLA.

\section{Safer Library Interfaces with TESLA} \label{sec:safer-libs}

In this section I describe the implementation of a mechanism by which a library
can use TESLA assertions to verify correct usage of the library by user code.
First, I relate the problem to the difficulties encountered when attempting to
apply TESLA to \lwip{} in \autoref{sec:lwip}. Then, I describe the construction of
such an interface using TESLA. Finally, I successfully apply the technique to an
existing server application from the \lwip{} distribution.

\subsection{Motivation}

In \autoref{sec:lwip} I investigated how TESLA instrumentation could be applied
to the internal implementation of \lwip{}, concluding that the most useful place
for instrumentation is at the boundary between user and library code.  However,
the use of user-registered callbacks means that the library cannot use TESLA to
make assertions on user behaviour.

A solution to this problem should allow users to consume the \lwip{} libraries as
they would when using the callback API, while also allowing the library to add
TESLA assertions about the behaviour of user code. This would mean the library
is able to enforce temporal safety properties of user programs without any prior
knowledge of the programs.

\subsection{Implementation Strategy}

\lwip{} distributes a number of example applications that consume the internal TCP
API by using callbacks as described previously---the simplest of these is an
implementation of the echo protocol \cite{RFC0862}. In this section I describe a
modified version of this application that includes TESLA assertions supplied by
the library.

In normal usage, a program using the \lwip{} TCP library calls a library function
with a function pointer argument to register their application-specific
callbacks. This is a very flexible approach that gives the program fine-grained
control over how it interacts with the library. \autoref{fig:callbacks} shows
how the program interacts with a library using this approach.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[code] (call1) {\texttt{callback\textsubscript{1}}};
    \node[code,below=of call1] (call2) {\texttt{callback\textsubscript{2}}};
    \node[below=of call2] (calletc) {...};
    \node[code,below=of calletc] (calln) {\texttt{callback\textsubscript{n}}};
    \node[above=of call1] (req) {};
    \node[code,right=of |(req)(calln),span vertical=(req)(calln)] (lib) {\texttt{liblwip}};
    \node[code,left=of |(req)(calln),span vertical=(req)(calln)] (prog) {\texttt{program}};

    \draw[-latex] (call2) -- (call2 -| prog.east);
    \draw[-latex] (calln) -- (calln -| prog.east);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Default usage of the \lwip{} callback API}
  \label{fig:callbacks}
\end{figure}

To add TESLA assertions, user programs must implement a static interface that
can be linked with the library. The primary loss of flexibility with this
approach is that users cannot change their callback functions at compile time.
However, this is not yet a complete solution. Each TESLA assertion must be
placed at a source location on the execution path it asserts over---intuitively,
this would be within the user-supplied interface functions themselves. Because
the definitions of these functions are not available to the library ahead of
time, it must implement wrapper functions. These wrappers call through to the
user-supplied interface functions, as well as containing the library TESLA
assertions. \autoref{fig:callbacks-tesla} shows how a program interacts with the
library in this modified usage model.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[code] (call1) {\texttt{interface\textsubscript{1}}};
    \node[code,below=of call1] (call2) {\texttt{interface\textsubscript{2}}};

    \draw[-latex] (call1.north) to ($ (call1.north) + (0,0.5) $) to ($ (call1.north -| lib.west) + (0,0.5) $);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Usage of the \lwip{} callback API with TESLA instrumentation}
  \label{fig:callbacks-tesla}
\end{figure}

Adapting the echo server to use this model required only that the
wrapper functions and corresponding assertions were written---almost no
modification of the application code was required beyond removing the callback
registration calls.

This adaptation results in two versions of the server application--one where
static analysis has been applied to the library assertions, and one where it has
not been.

\subsection{Summary}

In this section I have shown how TESLA can be used by library developers to
apply temporal assertions to users of the library without prior knowledge of the
user code. Additionally, I have demonstrated a method for adapting library
interfaces not explicitly designed with TESLA instrumentation in mind. This
technique was applied successfully to an existing application (with minimal
modification to application code). In \autoref{sec:eval-app} I give a detailed
evaluation of the performance of the instrumented applications.

The methods developed have some shortcomings when compared to typical C library
development:
\begin{description}
  \item[Distribution] A library developed using these methods must be
    distributed as LLVM bitcode together with the associated TESLA
    manifest---this means that users must install the TESLA toolchain and adapt
    their build process to use the library.

  \item[Safety] TESLA assertions on a library interface can only usefully
    enforce properties of the functions in the interface---it is easy to construct
    user code that circumvents these assertions by executing unsafe code (for
    example, \textcquote[p. 13]{anderson_tesla:_2014}{casting data to
    \mintinline{c}{char *} and manipulating raw bytes}).

  \item[Performance] If the user code is amenable to static analysis, then the
    performance impact of TESLA is minimal. However, this is dependent on how
    the user code is written.
\end{description}

Despite these issues, the interface adaptation technique is still a useful tool
for library developers to prevent bugs in user code. Additionally, it represents
a significant generalisation compared to previous applications of TESLA.
