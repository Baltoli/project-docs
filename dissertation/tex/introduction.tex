The tools available for programmers to assert the correctness of their
code are almost always \emph{instantaneous}---assertions can be made
about the current state of the program, but not about previous or future
states. As a result, \emph{temporal} properties of programs are often
checked informally or not at all.

TESLA \cite{anderson_tesla:_2014} provides systems programmers with a
means of mechanically checking temporal properties of their code by
modifying the compilation process to insert instrumentation into
programs. This approach proved successful---a number of bugs in large
open-source libraries were identified and fixed with the help of
temporal assertions. However, using TESLA imposes some runtime
performance overhead on a program, and so its usage so far has been
restricted to debugging scenarios where such this overhead is
acceptable.

In this report I propose the use of \emph{static analysis} for
optimisation of TESLA assertions---if an assertion can be proved correct
at compile time, then its instrumentation code can be omitted from the
program. This has a number of benefits. For example, the program is
likely to be smaller and faster than if the instrumentation were
included, and potential counterexamples to assertions can be given to
the programmer as a useful debugging tool in their own right.

I motivate the use of static analysis by providing an implementation of
a small data structure with associated TESLA assertions, along with a
benchmark showing the runtime performance overhead of these assertions.
Then, I demonstrate a set of highly specialised program analyses that
can be used to prove the correctness of these assertions in particular.
From there, I contribute a translation of TESLA assertions to finite
state automata that formalises components of the original work. I use
this translation to describe an algorithm for checking the correctness
of a program with respect to a checkable subset of TESLA assertions.
Finally, I give an implementation of this algorithm that can be easily
integrated into the existing TESLA toolchain.

To evaluate this model checker, I perform an investigation into how
TESLA can be applied to a production-standard implementation of a
network protocol stack (with emphasis on the potential of statically
analysing this instrumentation). Then, motivated by the difficulties
encountered during this process, I contribute a general framework for
library authors to make temporal assertions about client code using the
library. I give an example application written using this framework and
show the large performance benefits available by applying static
analysis.
