TESLA \cite{anderson_tesla:_2014} is a tool that allows for temporal assertions
  to be written about C programs, expressing richer safety properties than
  traditional development tools can. However, adding temporal assertions to a
  program incurs a significant runtime performance overhead. As a result, the
  usefulness of TESLA is limited to debugging scenarios where this overhead is
  acceptable. 
  
  I formalise the assertion language used by TESLA, then use the formalism to
  develop a \emph{model checker} for a subset of its assertions, demonstrating
  its usefulness by applying it to a TESLA-instrumented implementation of mutual
  exclusion locks. I analyse the usefulness of TESLA with respect to a large,
  widely-used open source library, finding that commonly used source code
  features greatly inhibit useful application of TESLA. Based on these results,
  I improve on previous work by describing a general method for applying TESLA
  to library interfaces, then apply the method successfully to an existing
  server application. I analyse the performance overhead of TESLA
  instrumentation in this server, finding a $40\%$ overhead for as few as five
  assertions. Applying the model checker to prove these assertions at compile
  time eliminates the runtime overhead completely while retaining the asserted
  safety properties.
